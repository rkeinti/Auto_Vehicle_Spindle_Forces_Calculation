### Auto Vehicle Spindle forces Calculation with Machine Learning

**Robert Bodombo Keinti**

#### Executive summary

This code shows how to calculate the spindle forces whith knuckle accelerations, damper displacement and damper velocity.

#### Rationale

This method help reduce cost related to the rental and installation of wheel force transducer equipments.

#### Research Question

Can Machile learning be used to predict spindle forces when we have knuckle accelerations and damper displacement and velocity

#### Data Sources

The data is from a vehicle data acquisition.

#### Methodology

An attempt is made using:
- Linear Regression,
- KNN Regression,
- Decision Tree Regression,
- SVR and
- Neural Network.


#### Results


Machine learning can be used to predict spindle loads. KNN is the best tool to use in this case.

#### Next steps

Combine multiple events in one single dataframe for a better results
